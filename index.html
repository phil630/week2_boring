    <p> This is a test. This is a test. This is a test. HI HI</p>
    
    <article> This is about hamsters. I use to have 4 hamsters. Sadly, they passed away. But one of them looked exactly  like this. His name was skunky. He died of old age I would assume.</article>

    <footer>So this is the end of the website. I hope you had fun viewing this. Please do not pay any attention to this as I make no sense. I will build a better website- I promise you. But until then, you have to read this and understand that this is just a fake site. Thank you again!</footer>
